# Module_5
Overview
In this project, I have written a software program in C++ to demonstrate my understanding of the language syntax. As a software engineer, my goal with this project is to further my learning and showcase my proficiency in C++. The software includes various features such as calculations, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and the usage of data structures from the Standard Template Library (STL).
